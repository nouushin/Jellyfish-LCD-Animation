# Jellyfish-LCD-Animation
This is a project for the animation of a Jellyfish that I made for my Computer Engineer Technician Diploma program. The code has some errors and is mostly done to function in the Board that Niagara College provides to their students.

It is intended to serve as a reference for students who also want to try animating and create custom characters as a project or hobbie, and as per the license, you can also use it as a copy. Please be mindful that this is an incomplete project and I am still in the process of modifying it even tho it was already submitted for my course.

The orginal header codes were created by two of my instructors "Mike Boldin" and "Mark Cools", all creadits for the C code files go to them and any distribution of those are prohibed.
